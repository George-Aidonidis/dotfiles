Personal dotfiles that I use for my thinpad E570 (running two screens).

## Programs whose configs can be found here

+ i3 (i3-gaps)
+ NeoVim
+ zsh
+ tmux
+ ranger
+ dunst (for notifications)
+ redshift
+ polybar
+ redshift (to adjust color temperature of the screens)
+ compton (For transparency and to stop screen tearing)
+ And many, many little scripts I use

## How to setup

Stow is used to help settings things up (instead of manually creating symlinks etc...). In that way you can have a `dotfiles` folder in your `$HOME` folder instead of hacking around on version controlling (like adding root folder and ignoring everything non relevant).
